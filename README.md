There are 7 circles with white background.
You have to use 7 rainbow colors to fill that circle on click, and it has to be in order ROYGBIV (OPPOSITE OF VIBGYOR),

eg. red colour should fill to clicked circle, then orange colour should get filled to clicked color so forth and so on.......

If you click coloured circle, it will turn back to white color.
